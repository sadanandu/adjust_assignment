# adjust_assignment

A REST API developed using Django Rest Framework. 
It allows user to filter datasets based on all fields, using different criteria like before_date,after_date, min_installs, max_installs, etc.
It also allows user to order (sort) data using any field in ascending or descending order by providing query params like ordering=+installs, ordering=-installs 
Currently the API is not able to handle group by queries, the work is in progress.
